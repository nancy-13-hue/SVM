#Titanic Survival Prediction with Minimal Dataset (SVM)
This project demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict survival on the Titanic based on a minimal dataset with only two columns: Passenger and Survived. This example showcases how to work with minimal data and applies basic machine learning techniques for classification.
The dataset used in this project (titanic.csv) has only two columns:
Passenger:	A unique identifier for each passenger (could be any identifier)
Survived:	Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - Target variable

This project illustrates the importance of features in machine learning. While the code demonstrates how to train and evaluate an SVM model, the performance is not meaningful due to the lack of useful features. For a robust model, more relevant data would be required.

This example serves as a starting point for understanding the workflow of applying SVM on classification tasks, but in real-world scenarios, meaningful features are essential for building effective models.
